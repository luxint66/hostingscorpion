Centering Image on Page

the image appears in the middle but at the bottom of the screen. It should be centered both vert and horiz on both desktop and mobile...

To center the image both vertically and horizontally on both desktop and mobile, we need to adjust the CSS for the .background-image class. The current issue is that the image is positioned relative to the oversized container, which is causing it to appear at the bottom. Let's modify the HTML and CSS to achieve the desired centering effect.


Centered Image HTML

Here are the key changes made to center the image both vertically and horizontally on desktop and mobile:

Changed the body and html styles to have 100% height and use flexbox for centering.
Modified the .container to use flexbox for centering its contents.
Adjusted the .radial-effect to cover the entire viewport and more by setting its size to 200% and using a negative transform.
Updated the .background-image class to use max-width: 100% and max-height: 100% along with object-fit: contain to ensure the image scales properly while maintaining its aspect ratio.
Added z-index: 1 to the .background-image to ensure it appears above the radial effect.
These changes should center the image both vertically and horizontally on all screen sizes while maintaining the radial background effect. The image will scale to fit the screen while preserving its aspect ratio.
